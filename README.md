# kenko

## Getting Started

This project is to solve the issue of inconsistent and inconvenient tracking of food intake, exercise, and weight progress for individuals working toward their fitness goals.

- ### Kenko is a mobile application designed to help users take control of their health and fitness journey
- This app allows users to upload their daily intake and track their calorie values.
- Users can select exercise activities they perform and track the calories burned. 
- On the other side, the app tracks weight progress with respect to time, while the map-based gym locator allows for filtering between women-only and regular gyms.
- Kenko combines diet, exercise, step tracking, and location-based services to give you a one-stop location for your fitness goals.
