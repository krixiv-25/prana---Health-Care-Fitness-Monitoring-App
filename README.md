Prana
Getting Started

Prana is a mobile application designed to help individuals maintain a healthy and balanced lifestyle by simplifying how they track their food intake, exercise routines, and weight progress.

Prana helps users take complete control of their health and fitness journey.

Users can log their daily meals and automatically track their calorie intake.

They can choose exercise activities they perform and monitor the calories they burn.

The app visualizes weight progress over time and includes a map-based gym locator that lets users filter between women-only and regular gyms.

Prana integrates diet tracking, exercise monitoring, step tracking, and location-based services â€” making it your all-in-one fitness companion.
